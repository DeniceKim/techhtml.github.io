<h1>더 안전한 웹을 향한 W3C 활동 가속</h1>
<h2>W3C는 웹에서 FIDO 얼라이언스 스펙문서를 기반으로 패스워드 로그인을 대체하는
    더 안전하고 유연한 웹 인증 작업을 시작하였습니다.</h2>

<p id="desc"><a href="http://www.w3.org/">http://www.w3.org/</a> — 2016년 2월 17일 (미국동부시간) —
    월드 와이드 웹 컨소시움(World Wide Web Consortium, W3C)은
    모든 사람이 원하는 더 안전한 웹을 위한 조건을 구현화하기 위해
    <a title="Web Authentication Working Group Charter"
       href="https://www.w3.org/2015/12/web-authentication-charter.html">Web
        Authentication</a>을 발족했습니다.
    이 워킹 그룹에서는 웹에서 패스워드를 사용한 로그인을 대신할, 더 유연하고 확실한 방식을 의논하고 개발합니다.
    <br>

    많은 웹 유저에게, 패스워드는 사용하기에 짜증스럽고, 여러 인터렉션을 통해 보안이 약해지는 난점이 있었습니다.
    패스워드 분실, 충분하지 않은 나열, 혹은 추측하기 쉬운 패스워드를 설정하는 케이스가 많이 있습니다.
    견고한 패스워드일지라도 데이터가 파괴되거나, 피싱 공격의 타겟이 되기도 합니다.
    W3C의 새 웹 인증 작업은, FIDO 얼라이언스의 FIDO 2.0 웹 API를 기본으로 둔,
    패스워드 인증을 대신할 견고한 암호에 의한 인증을 가능하게 합니다.
    <br>

    웹의 발명자이자 W3C 디렉터인 팀 버너스 리 경은,
    "강력한 인증방식을 간단하게 사용할 수 있다면 웹은 개인이나 상용에 일상적으로 사용할 수 있을 겁니다.
     나날히 늘어나는 외부의 공격에 대응하여, W3C는 새롭고 효율적으로 매우 우수한 수법을 표준화해야합니다" 라 말했습니다.
    <br>
</p>
<h2>웹 인증은 현재 W3C 웹 보안 활동에 만전을 기합니다<br>
</h2>
<p>According to W3C CEO Dr. Jeff Jaffe, the Web Authentication effort will
    complement prior W3C work on a Web Cryptography API, currently in <a title="WebCryptoAPI CR"
                                                                         href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/">Candidate
        Recommendation</a> status, and on-going work on <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/webappsec/">Web
        Application Security </a>specifications.&nbsp; The WebCrypto API
    provides a Javascript API to a standard suite of cryptographic operations
    across browsers. Work in WebAppSec includes improvements to the HTTPS
    experience and updates to Content Security Policy (CSP), enabling
    application authors to set policy for what active content is permitted to
    run on their sites, protecting them against injection of unwanted or
    malicious code.<br>
</p>
<p> "Our goal is to raise the entire Open Web Platform to a higher standard
    of security and to collaborate with industry, academic experts, and other
    standards organizations to ensure that specific Web security needs are
    met," Jaffe said. "We invite broad participation to work together on this
    top priority to keep the Web as secure as possible today and in the
    foreseeable future."<br>
    <br>
    Wendy Seltzer, Technology and Society Domain Lead, says she expects the
    new Web Authentication work to close an important gap in the Web platform.
    "We've seen much better authentication methods than passwords, yet too
    many Web sites still use password-based log-ins. Standard Web APIs will
    make consistent implementations work across the Web ecosystem. The new
    approach will replace passwords with more secure ways of logging into Web
    sites, such as using a USB key or activating a smartphone. Strong
    authentication is useful to any Web application that wants to maintain an
    ongoing relationship with users," Seltzer commented. <br>
</p>
<h2>FIDO 2.0 Web APIs to Jumpstart Web Authentication Work<br>
</h2>
<p>The W3C's Web Authentication technical work is being accelerated thanks
    to a <a title="FIDO member submission" href="https://www.w3.org/blog/2015/11/w3c-fido/">W3C
        member submission</a> of FIDO 2.0 Web APIs from members of the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org">FIDO
        Alliance</a>. The submitted APIs are intended to ensure standards-based
    strong authentication across all Web browsers and related Web platform
    infrastructure.<br>
</p>
<p>"Our mission is to revolutionize authentication on the Web through the
    development and global adoption of technical specifications that supplant
    the world's dependency on passwords with interoperable strong
    authentication," said Brett McDowell, executive director of the FIDO
    Alliance.&nbsp; "With W3C's acceptance of the FIDO 2.0 submission, and the
    chartering of this new Web Authentication Working Group, we are well on
    our way to accomplishing that mission." <br>
</p>
<p>The new <a href="https://www.w3.org/Webauthn/">Web Authentication
    Working Group</a>'s first meeting will take place 4 March 2016 in San
    Francisco, conveniently timed for people who are also attending the RSA
    USA Conference. All W3C standards activities take place in <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/activities">Working
        Groups</a> that are open to participation by W3C members and provide
    public mailing lists and repositories for public comment. <br>
</p>
<p> "The developers and engineers involved in W3C’s efforts to improve Web
    security are keenly aware of the need to upgrade protocols without
    breaking the Web that billions of people rely on," said Seltzer.&nbsp; "We
    very much encourage those interested in helping W3C to build a more secure
    Web to get involved."<br>

    <p id="NokNok">The W3C's new Web Authentication work, based upon the FIDO Alliance
        submission of FIDO 2.0 Web APIs, is a huge step towards realizing our
